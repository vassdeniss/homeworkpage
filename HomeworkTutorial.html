        <h1> Hyper Text Markup Language <br> Tutorial </h1>
        <h2> Alright y'all I'll keep this brief </h2>
        <p> Hyper Text Markup Language - HTML is used to make web pages for the world wide web </p>
        <p> 
            The components of making a fully working web page are three - 
            HTML, CSS and JS (Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript) 
        </p>
        <p> For now lets concentrate on HTML only. Writing HTML is very easy and ill show you how! </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> 
            For the sake of ease I'll write HTML code in 
            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"> red </span> 
        </p>
        <pre style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color:red;"> 
            &#60!DOCTYPE html&#62
            &#60html&#62
            &#60head&#62
            &#60title&#62Example Title&#60/title&#62
            &#60/head&#62
            &#60body&#62
            &#60h1&#62Example Header&#60/h1&#62
            &#60p&#62Example Text&#60/p&#62
            &#60/body&#62
            &#60/html&#62
        </pre>
        <p> This is a working example of a HTML file structure. I'll now explain each of the things you see. </p>
        <p> But first lemme fix this mess... </p>
        <pre style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color:red;"> 
            &#60!DOCTYPE html&#62
            &#60html&#62

                &#60head&#62

                    &#60title&#62 Example Title &#60/title&#62

                &#60/head&#62

                &#60body&#62

                    &#60h1&#62 Example Header &#60/h1&#62
                    &#60p&#62 Example Text &#60/p&#62

                &#60/body&#62

            &#60/html&#62
        </pre>
        <p> Much easier to read right? That's one way I recommend to format your code - by simply spacing and tabbing </p>
        <p> Now lets explain it! </p>
        <p>  
            Whats a tag in HTML? A tag is written inside
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60 &#62. </span>
            You must end tags by typing
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60/ &#62. </span>
            So to write content you open a tag, write code, close tag!
        </p>
        <p> 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60!DOCTYPE html&#62 </span> 
            - Simply says to the browser that this document is an HTML document. Not required but recommended 
        </p>
        <p> 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60html&#62 </span> 
            - There is not much to know about this tag. You must have it and all your code must be between it. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60head&#62 </span> 
            - You can customize CSS inside the head, load external CSS, load page icons and much more! 
        </p>
        <p> 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60title&#62 </span> 
            - The name of the web page that apears on top on the little tab in your browser!  
        </p>
        <p> 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60body&#62 </span> 
            - The literal body of your page! Everything that your page will containg goes between 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60body&#62 </span> 
        </p>
        <p> 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60h1&#62 </span> 
            - Stands for "header" and is the big bolded title on your page! You can use 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60h1&#62 </span> 
            through 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60h6&#62 </span> 
            to make more headers that are smaller in size!
        </p>
        <p> 
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60p&#62 </span> 
            - Stands for "paragraph" and used to write text on your page! You can of course add a 
            lot of styling to the paragraphs but leave that for now!
            If you want to add a break to the paragraph and start a new line use this: <br>
            Example: <br>
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60p&#62 </span> 
            This is line one.
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60br&#62 </span> 
            And now this will be line two!
            <span style="color: red;"> &#60/p&#62 </span> 
        </p>
        <p> 
            That is pretty much the very very basics. <br> I left a
            <a href="HomeworkTutorial-Example.html"> link </a>
            if you want to see how would a page look like with this code!
